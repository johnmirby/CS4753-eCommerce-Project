CS4753 eCommerce Project

Evan's project description:
"The system is designed to take and evaluate websites. The flow of the website is as follows. The consumer pays a small amount of money (dependent of the services they want to be used on their website). They then provide a URL of the website that they want to be tested, as well as the IP addresses of any servers they wish to be tested. The service then does some of the following operations. It ensures that the website complies with the latest HTML standards. It ensures that all links to all resources (as well as other pages) work. It reports how quickly the website returns to queries originating at different locations. It does statistics on the response time of the servers you provide the ips of."
